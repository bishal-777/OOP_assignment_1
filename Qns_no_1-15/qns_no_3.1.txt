The differences between OOP and POP are given below:
S.N    OOP                                                                              POP
1.     Emphasis is given on data.                                                       Emphasis is given on function.
2.     Programs are divided into objects.                                               Programs are divided into functions.
3.     Follows bottom up approach of program design.                                    Follows top down approach of program design.
4.     Data can be hidden.                                                              Generally, data canâ€™t be hidden.
4.     Maintaining codes is easier.                                                     Maintaining codes is very difficult.

The differences between C and C++ are given below:
C                                                                                       C++
1. It was introduced by Dennis Ritche at Bell Lab in 1972.                              It was introduced by Bjarne Stroustup at Bell Lab in 1985.
2. C has been implemented by GCC,Borland C, Microsoft and many more.                    C++ has been implemented by GCC, MS visual C++,C++ builder.
3. This language is influenced by B, BCPL,ALGOL, etc.                                   This language is influenced by C, Simula 67, Ada 83,etc.
4. It follows procedural approach of program design.                                    It follows object oriented approach of program design.
5. C application are faster to compile than C++ application.                            C++ application are slower to compile than C

The differences between C adn C++ by program is shown in qns_no_3.2.1 and qns_no_3.2.2.
