Differentiate between: 

1. C structure and C++ structure. 

                             C structure                                                                          C++ structure 

Syntax:              Defined using the struct keyword.                                                   Defined using the struct keyword (same as C), but 
                                                                                                         can use the class keyword for more advanced features. 

Members:             All members are public by default.                                                  All members are public by default, but can use private 
                                                                                                         and protected access specifiers. 
                                                                                                         
Member Functions:    Cannot have member functions.                                                       Can have member functions.

Inheritance:         Does not support inheritance.                                                       Supports inheritance. 

 Access Modifiers:	 No support for access control; everything is public.                                Can use access specifiers (public, private, protected). 



2. C++ structure and class. 

                     C++ Structure                                                                        Class

Default Access:      Members are public by default.                                                       Members are private by default. 

Purpose:             Typically used for simple data structures.                                           Typically used for more complex data types and encapsulation
 
Inheritance:         Can be used in inheritance, but by default,                                          Can be used in inheritance, and by default,  
                     inheritance is public.                                                                inheritance is private.


3. Macros and inline functions. 

                     Macros                                                                                Inline Functions

Definition:        Preprocessor directives defined using #define.                                         Functions defined using the inline keyword.

Compilation:        Replaced by the preprocessor before compilation.                                       Integrated into the code during compilation. 


4. C++ structure and union. 

                    C++ Structure                                                                           C++ Union: 
 Definition:        A data type that can hold multiple members,                                            A data type that can hold multiple members, 
                    where each member has its own memory location.                                         but only one member can occupy the memory at any one time. 

Memory Allocation:  Each member has its own memory space, so the total 
                    memory used is the sum of all members' sizes.                                          Only enough memory to hold the largest member is allocated. 
                                                                                                            
 Access:            All members can be accessed simultaneously.                                            Only one member can be accessed at a time, and updating one 
                    member may affect the others.
