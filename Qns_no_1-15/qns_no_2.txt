Advantages:

2. It secures the data through the help of access specifiers, which restricts the access of data
    outside of the user desired function.
3. Code reusability is much easier. 
4. Upgrading and maintenance is much easier. 
5. Models real life problem perfectly. 

Disadvantages:
1. Compiler and runtime overhead is high because OOP requires long time to compilation.
2. Benefits in long run while managing large software projects. 
3. The message passing between many objects is complex and can be hard to trace.
