Type conversion in C++ is the conversion of one data type to another. There are
two ways of type conversion in C++. They are:

1. Implicit type conversion: 
Implicit type conversion is the way of converting onedata type to another automatically 
one the basis of priority order of the datatypes. Rule for implicit type conversion is 
given below:

char
short
int
long
float
double
long double

The above order is from lower type to higher type.

2. Explicit type conversion: 
Explicit type conversion is the way of converting one data type into required data type. 

By Using static_cast keyword:
Explicit conversion can be done using the keyword static_cast.
Syntax:
Static_cast <data_type> variable_name
