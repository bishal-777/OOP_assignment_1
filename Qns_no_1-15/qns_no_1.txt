OOP(Object oriented programming) is a approach in programming which treats real life entities as object.
POP(Procedural Oriented Programming) is a approach in programming which views problem in sequence of tasks.

OOP is better than POP because of the following reasons:
1. In OOP,code is organized into objects, making it easier to manage.
2. OOP allows reusing code through inheritance.
3. It Protects data by hiding it inside objects.
4. Makes it easier to model real-world situations.
5. Easier to update and expand the code than POP.
6. It uses data abstraction which hides unnecessary code.

The issues with POP are given below:
1. POP focuses on functions rather than data.
2. The use of global data is error prone,and it could be an obstacle in code maintainence and enhancements.
3. It is difficult to hide information to unauthorized user.
4. In a large program,it is diificult to identify belongings of global data.
