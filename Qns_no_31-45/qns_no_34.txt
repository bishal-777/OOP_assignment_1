Q. What are static data members ? List out its properties.

Static data members are the variables in class which only has a single copy in that class.

The properties of static data members are as follows:
(1)All static variables are initialized to zero when the first object is created.
(2)The type and scope of each static member variable must be defined outside the class.
(3)When we precede a member variables's delclaration with static,we are telling the compilere that there 
    only exists one copy of that variable,So static variables are called class variables.
(4)Individual copies of static member variables  are not made  for each object.So all objects of that class
    use single variable;
