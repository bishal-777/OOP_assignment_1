51. Differentiate between constructor and destructor. 

Constructor	 

1.Constructor helps to initialize the object of a class. 
2.It is declared as :
className( arguments if any ){Constructor’s Body }. 
3.Constructor can either accept arguments or not.	 
4.A constructor is called when an instance or object of a class is created.	 
5.Constructor is used to allocate the memory to an instance or object. 
6.Constructor can be overloaded.	 
7.The constructor’s name is same as the class name.	 
8.In a class, there can be multiple constructors.	 
9.There is a concept of copy constructor which is used to initialize an object from another object.	 
10.They are often called in successive order. 

 

 

 Destructor 

1.Destructor is used to destroy the instances. 
2.It is declared as :
~ className( no arguments ){ }. 
3.It can’t have any arguments. 
4.It is called while object of the class is freed or deleted. 
5.It is used to deallocate the memory of an object of a class. 
6.It can’t be overloaded. 
7.Here, its name is also same as the class name preceded by the tiled (~) operator. 
8. In a class, there is always a single destructor. 
9.Here, there is no copy destructor concept. 
10.They are often called in reverse order of constructor.
