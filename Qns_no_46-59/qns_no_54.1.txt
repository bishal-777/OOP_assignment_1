Q. List the properties for constant member function and constant object.
Write their syntax.also write a program to show constant member functions and constant object. 

Characteristics of constant member functions: 

1.Declaration with const Keyword: 
A constant member function is declared with the const keyword at the end of its signature. 

2.Cannot Modify Member Variables: 
Inside a constant member function, you cannot modify any non-mutable member variables of the class. 

3.Can Call Other Constant Member Functions: 
A constant member function can call other constant member functions of the same class. 

4.Cannot Call Non-constant Member Functions: 
A constant member function cannot call non-constant member functions. 

5.Can Modify mutable Members: 
A constant member function can modify member variables that are declared with the mutable keyword. 

6.Can Access Static Members: 
A constant member function can access static member variables and call static member functions. 

7.Use with Overloading: 
You can overload member functions based on their const-ness. 

 




 

 

8.Const Object Calls Only Const Member Functions: 

A constant object (an object declared with the const keyword) can only call constant member functions.
