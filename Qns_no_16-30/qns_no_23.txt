Write syntax for class and objects. Explain briefly about access specifier.

Syntax for class and objects :
Class class-name
{
    //access specifier
data member1;
member function_1;
...
...
data membern;
member function_n

};
Int main()
{
Class_name object_name;
// code
}


Access specifiers are one of the major components of OOP. It is used to grant access to the
member functions and data members of the class. There are three types of access specifiers
in OOP. They are:

1. Private access specifiers :
Private access specifiers are special types of access specifiers. They are
used to keep the data member and member functions private and it grants access to
those data member and member functions within that class only. It denies if member
functions and data members are called outside the class.

2. Public access specifiers :
Public access specifiers are used to grant access to data members and
member functions from any part of the code. It keeps data members and member functions
publically available so that they can be fetched from any part of our code.

3. Protected access specifiers:
Protected access specifiers are the special type of access specifiers. They
are used to keep the data members and member functions protected and these can
be accessed within the class and other classes. We need to grant access to other
classes if we need to use the data members and member functions stored in
protected access specifiers.
